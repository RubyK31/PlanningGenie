                    <p class="body-16 pt-4">If a Planning Genie could grant a wish, it would be that the planning system
                        in England was friendly,
                        helpful and accessible to everyone - whether extending your home or expanding your town.</p>

                    <p class="lh-lg">However, the planning system can be slow, unpredictable, frustrating and
                        restrictive. </p>

                    <p class="lh-lg">For anyone who is not a planning professional, understanding the jargon and dealing
                        with the planning system can be very daunting.
                        The system encompasses policies, processes and guidance that can stand between you achieving
                        planning permission and realising your
                        property dreams. </p>

                    <p class="lh-lg">It is difficult to know where best to find information and often planning offiicers
                        within councils are not available to discuss
                        ideas and proposals informally.</p>

                    <p class="lh-lg">Planning Genie's pre-recorded, online masterclasses give people anywhere in
                        England, at any time, access to the information they need
                    <p class="lh-lg">Planning Genie's pre-recorded, online masterclasses give people anywhere in
                        England, at any time, access to the information they need
                        to start their planning journeys. Genie helps land and property owners navigate the planning
                        system by demystifying the planning process. </p>

                    </p>
                    <p class="lh-lg">As a Chartered Town and Country Planning Consultant and a member of the Royal Town
                        Planning Institute, I work closely with homeowners,
                        landowners, farmers, property investors and property professionals who have lots of questions
                        about the 'what, why, how, and when' of planning. </p>

                    <p class="lh-lg">I know how clunky the planning system can sometimes be. Through my planning
                        consultancy, LP Planning, I help my clients understand and navigate
                        the planning system. I demystify the policies and processes, unpicking the rules to fiind the
                        right solutions for their projects.
                        I work to make the planning journey as easy and pain free as possible.</p>

                    <p class="lh-lg">Until the lockdown of 2019, most of my client interactions were face to face and on
                        site. I then started providing online masterclasses and that's
                        when I realised that I could help more people, in England, demystify the planning system by
                        taking my business online. Planning Genie was born.</p>

                    <p class="lh-lg">It gives me pleasure to help land and property owners to have a positive experience
                        of the planning system and to increase their chances of
                        gaining planning permission. After 20 years' experience, I enjoy working with my clients and
                        still get excited by the projects I work on.
                        Through launching Planning Genie,I now have the opportunity to help more people increase their
                        chances of getting planning permission fiirst time.</p>

                    <p class="lh-lg">I met Charlotte over ten years ago, and we have worked together on a shared vision
                        of establishing a company that could address some of the issues in the planning system.
                        For those embarking on land and building projects, navigating the planning system can be
                        difficult. We feel strongly that there is opportunity to help people
                        better understand what can and can't be done, as well as detailing the steps you need to take to
                        improve your chances of getting planning permission for your
                        projects. </p>

                    <p class="lh-lg">My role at Planning Genie is cross functional and focuses on the business aspects
                        of bringing Genie to life. I lead on the development of the business and
                        marketing strategy, and work closely with Charlotte on product development. </p>
